  This is the "Cardboard Creations" page, in which I showcase two of my best cardboard
  creations - a Spartan helmet and an Iron Man helmet, with pictures, describing
  how they were made.

      <h1 id="name">My Cardboard Creations</h1>
      <p>Making things out of cardboard is one of my favorite hobbies. It may sound weird at
        first, but it is really fun to do! It originally started from when I was asked to make
        props for a class drama in sixth grade. Ever since then, I have created a lot of
        objects out of cardboard - from things such as drawer organizers and shelves to my
        favorite project so far: an Iron Man helmet!<br>
        (P.S. None of the pictures are mine, since all my creations are currently in Oman. As
        a result, for now I am using images of creations that look similar to mine.)

          This was the first of my helmet-related project, and took some tries to build. To build
          this helmet, I had to first create an "outer skeletal structure" of my head, in order to
          get the correct head size. Then, I used paper strips soaked in a mixture of glue and water
          to cover the structure, which led to a hard, rigid "head cover" of the helmet. That was
          the hardest step to do. After that, I just had to cut the outer "face cover" out of
          a piece of cardboard and attach the two pieces together.</p>

          One of the most fun projects to do, this was more complicated than the Spartan one due
          to all the details, some of which I had to ignore during the making of this helmet.
          I first used the same "outer skeleton" structure. However, in this case, the glue-water
          approach was unnecessary since the entire helmet was out of cardboard and had different
          components. I mainly used a template, cut it out, and glued the pieces together to form
          the finished helmet.
